        </h5>
        <h5><u>VALUES AND MENTALITY </u></h5>
        <h5>Eweek strives to promote and uphold the spirit of camaraderie and community amongst Engineers and Friendgineers through a month-long interdepartmental competition that exists in a safe, fun and inclusive environment.
        </h5>
        <h5><u>RESPECT, APPROPRIATE CONDUCT AND CONSEQUENCES</u></h5>
        <h5>Proper Behaviour
        </h5>
          <ol>
            <li>I will behave in a manner that will uphold McGill’s reputation and the reputation of the Engineering Undergraduate Society
            </li>
              <li>I will maintain an appropriate relationship between myself and all E-Week participants and members of the University and the general public.
              </li>
              <li>I will not engage in any behavior or attitude or produce any media that is or has potential to be offensive, obscene, exclusive, or hurtful toward any E-Week participant, Staff or Coordinator or any member of the University or general public; this includes, but is not limited to, remarks or actions that disparage race, sex, gender, sexuality, physical or mental ability, age, class, religion, personal choices, etc.
              </li>
          </ol>
          <h5>Consent
          </h5>
          <ol>
              <li>I acknowledge that consent is an informed, affirmative, voluntary, unambiguous, and conscious decision by each participant to engage in mutually agreed-upon sexual activity. I will only participate in consensual sexual activity and I understand that should the E-Week Coordinators find reason to believe that I have engaged in any form of misconduct, I will immediately be removed from E-Week.
              </li>
          </ol>
          <h5>Violence
          </h5>
          <ol>
              <li>I acknowledge that E-Week exists in and upholds a space of zero tolerance for violence of any form which includes but is not limited to, physical violence, sexual violence, verbal violence, etc.
              </li>
          </ol>
          <h5>Venues (Virtual Spaces)
          </h5>
          <ol>
              <li>I will treat all spaces, staff and material I interact with throughout E-Week with respect and courtesy.

              </li>
          </ol>
          <h5>Code of Conduct
          </h5>
          <ol>
              <li>As a participant of E-Week, I acknowledge that the EUS has engaged in a Memorandum of Understanding with McGill University. This implies that every exclusive E-Week event is under the McGill Student Code of Conduct and that I can be held accountable through McGill’s disciplinary policies if any of my actions violate the student Code of Conduct.
              </li>
          </ol>
          <h5>Consequences
          </h5>
          <ol>
              <li>I understand that failure to comply with any of the terms listed in the entirety of the contract may result in the removal of my E-Week bracelet. My bracelet may be removed at any time,  by an E-Week Coordinator at their sole discretion.
              </li>
              <li>
                  I may be asked to withdraw from participation without a refund if my actions or behavior are deemed inappropriate by a coordinator of E-Week. If that happens, I will comply with the wish of the E-Week coordinator.
              </li>
          </ol>
          <h5><u>RESPECT, APPROPRIATE CONDUCT AND CONSEQUENCES</u></h5>
          <h5>My actions and their consequences are my own responsibility
          </h5>
